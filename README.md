# Javascript simple sessions

This is a sandbox to practice & test javascript

## Running the tests

  * `npm run test` will run the tests once
  * `grunt test-watch` will run the tests once, then watch your changes
  * `grunt test-watch --force` will do the above, but continue even if the tests are red. Might be useful for TDD

## Prerequisites
  
  * npm
  * grunt
  * The rest of dependencies should come via npm
